# Lab 03 Slicer#2: Data formats, getting data from MorphoSource, saving 
* image stacks vs volume files
* why nrrd/nifti
* image spacing, orientation
* pixel coordinates vs physical coordinates 
* DICOM import example 
* DICOM -> Nifti conversion (dcm2niix, or Slicer DICOM browser)
* sample data from MorphoSource 
* vector vs scalar volumes 
* other repositories (DigiMorph, and other listed on SlicerMorph project site)
* through review of save dialog box and all options (including MRB)
* downsampling/supersampling (ResampleScalarVolume)
* CropVolume (interpolated vs voxel, resampling at the time of cropping)
