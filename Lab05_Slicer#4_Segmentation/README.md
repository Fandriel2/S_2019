# Lab 05 Slicer#4: Segmentation, mesh conversion, 3D printing 
* What is a labelmap? Segmentation map?
* Segment Editor 
* Segment Editor Extra Effects extension (flood fill, mask/split volume, etc)
* Logical operations on segments
* Segmentations module (to export/import segmentation)
* segment statistics
* segment registration (extension, just make them aware)

* Surface Toolbox (for smoothing, decimation, etc, but not as many functions as Meshlab or Blender)
* Models Module (for displaying 3D models, manipulating color, opacity, stats)
* Bonus pointer to discussion on Segmentation to Finite Element ANalysis https://discourse.slicer.org/t/use-segmentations-in-cad-or-fem-software/1626
* also relevant Segment Mesher extension
