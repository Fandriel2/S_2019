# Lab 06 SlicerMorph # 2: Statistical Shape Analysis: Create and work with your data 

Landmarks should be collected in the same order and we assume each file contains the identical number of landmarks (you need to have landmarks, even they might not be present on some of your specimens). 

Even if you would like to digitize landmarks from the same specimen multiple times (e.g., to check your consistency), we require you to save each attempt as distinct files. Likewise, if you would like to digitize multiple sets of landmarks from the same articulated specimens (e.g., skull, mandible, dentition, so forth), please create separate markup nodes for each of them, and save them individually. 

If you have landmarks already done in some other program, fcsv format is a simple comma-separated file format, that you can use R or even Excel to convert your data
